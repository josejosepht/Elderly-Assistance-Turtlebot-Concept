# Elderly-Assistance-Turtlebot-Concept
This GitHub repository presents a conceptual proposal for a SLAM based Turtlebot with a manipulator arm aimed at assisting the elderly in their daily activities. The project envisions a voice-controlled robot capable of retrieving household objects based on voice commands given by the elderly individual. The repository explores the integration of hardware components such as the Raspberry Pi Camera Module, ReSpeaker 4 Mic Array, and the 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-01 (LIDAR). It also discusses potential algorithms and approaches for object recognition and path planning. This repository serves as a starting point for further exploration and development of this innovative concept.
